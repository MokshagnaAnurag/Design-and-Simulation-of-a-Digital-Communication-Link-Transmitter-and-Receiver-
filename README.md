# Design-and-Simulation-of-a-Digital-Communication-Link-Transmitter-and-Receiver-
This repository features MATLAB code for a digital communication system that simulates a link with transmitter and receiver components. It uses BPSK modulation, simulates AWGN effects, and evaluates Bit Error Rate (BER) across different SNR values, serving as an educational resource for communication systems.
